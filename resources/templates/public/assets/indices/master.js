All of these requirements are satisfied by the Laravel Homestead virtual machine, so it's highly recommended that you use Homestead as your local Laravel development environment.  However, if you are not using Homestead, you will need to make sure your server meets the following requirements:  \n\nPHP >= 7.1.3\nBCMath PHP Extension\nCtype PHP Extension\nJSON PHP Extension\nMbstring PHP Extension\nOpenSSL PHP Extension\nPDO PHP Extension\nTokenizer PHP Extension\nXML PHP Extension\n\n"},{"h2":"Installation","h3":"Installing Laravel","h4":"","name":"InstallingLaravel-h3","content":"Laravel utilizes Composer to manage its dependencies.

This directory exists in different locations based on your operating system; however, some common locations include:  \n\nmacOS: $HOME/.composer/vendor/bin\nGNU / Linux Distributions: $HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin\nWindows: %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Composer\\vendor\\bin\n\n  Once installed, the laravel new command will create a fresh Laravel installation in the directory you specify. For instance, laravel new blog will create a directory named blog containing a fresh Laravel installation with all of Laravel's dependencies already installed:  laravel new blog"},{"h2":"Installation","h3":"Installing Laravel","h4":"Via Composer Create-Project","name":"ViaComposerCreate-Project-h4","content":"Alternatively, you may also install Laravel by issuing the Composer create-project command in your terminal:  composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel blog"},{"h2":"Installation","h3":"Installing Laravel","h4":"Local Development Server","name":"LocalDevelopmentServer-h4","content":"If you have PHP installed locally and you would like to use PHP's built-in development server to serve your application, you may use the serve Artisan command.

If you installed Laravel via Composer or the Laravel installer, this key has already been set for you by the php artisan key:generate command.  Typically, this string should be 32 characters long. The key can be set in the .env environment file. If you have not renamed the .env.example file to .env, you should do that now. If the application key is not set, your user sessions and other encrypted data will not be secure!"},{"h2":"Installation","h3":"Configuration","h4":"Additional Configuration","name":"AdditionalConfiguration-h4","content":"Laravel needs almost no other configuration out of the box. You are free to get started developing! However, you may wish to review the config/app.php file and its documentation.
